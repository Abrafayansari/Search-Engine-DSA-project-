Data structures play a crucial role in computer science.
Efficient storage techniques help manage large volumes of information.
Arrays provide constant-time access but fixed-size limitations.
Linked lists offer dynamic memory usage with sequential traversal.
Stacks operate on a last-in first-out mechanism.
Queues follow the first-in first-out approach used in scheduling.
Trees enable hierarchical representation of complex data.
Binary search trees support efficient searching and insertion.
Balanced trees maintain height constraints for predictable performance.
Graphs model relationships between interconnected entities.
Weighted graphs allow cost-based routing and navigation.
Hash tables provide average constant-time lookups.
Collisions in hashing are handled using chaining or open addressing.
Sorting algorithms organize data in meaningful order.
Searching algorithms help retrieve information quickly.
Recursion simplifies complex logic through repeated function calls.
Iteration provides a controlled flow for repeated tasks.
File handling techniques manage data stored on disk.
Indexing improves the speed of data retrieval operations.
Data mining extracts useful patterns from large datasets.
Machine learning models train on structured and unstructured data.
Neural networks simulate human brain-like processing.
Optimization techniques enhance model performance and accuracy.
Distributed systems store data across multiple networked machines.
Cybersecurity ensures protection against unauthorized access.
